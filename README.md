# RemoteDesktopEnvironmentManager
This repository consists of the files which I created to access/open the RemoteDesktop Enviroment Manager tool created using SpringBoot, Java, JDBC, Maven, Thymeleaf, HTML and CSS.
You will be needing Maven and MySQL Workbench or SQL Server Management Studio to create the database and use it to store the files in them. 
This is just a rough idea of the work, will be updating it soon.
